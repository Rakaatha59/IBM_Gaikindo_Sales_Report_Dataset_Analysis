## Car Sales Trend Analysis in Indonesia Using IBM Granite Model

Using the Car Sales Dataset, I aim to explore patterns in automotive sales performance among the top five brands in Indonesia: Toyota, Honda, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, and Daihatsu.  
This project focuses on identifying market trends, seasonal fluctuations, and competitive positioning using IBM Granite’s natural language reasoning and analytical capabilities. The goal is to understand which brands perform best over time, detect potential sales cycles, and derive actionable business recommendations from AI-driven insights.

## Insight & Findings  

### **Insights**
This analysis reveals that external and seasonal factors strongly affect car sales in Indonesia.  Toyota consistently dominates the market, while Honda shows stable year-over-year growth. Fluctuations in sales often coincide with major economic or festive periods (e.g., before Eid al-Fitr or at the end of the year).  

AI-assisted interpretation from IBM Granite suggests that **brand reputation**, **model variety**, and **consumer affordability** are the most influential aspects driving sales volume, while **short-term promotions** and **price adjustments** play a secondary but supportive role.

### **Findings**

#### 1. Toyota and Honda Dominate the Market  
Both Toyota and Honda show strong market shares, together accounting for more than half of total unit sales.  
Their consistency is supported by brand trust, dealer networks, and continuous model innovation.  

#### 2. Seasonal Effects Drive Short-Term Spikes  
Sales tend to rise in Q2 (April–June) and Q4 (October–December), likely due to holiday seasons and year-end promotions.  
This indicates that timing campaigns and new product releases during these periods can maximize returns.

#### 3️. Mitsubishi Shows Aggressive Recovery Patterns  
Although overall volume is smaller, Mitsubishi exhibits rapid spikes during new model releases, showing high sensitivity to marketing initiatives and product launches.

#### 4️. Suzuki and Daihatsu Experience Higher Volatility  
Both brands face stronger fluctuations due to competitive pricing strategies and limited model segmentation.  
Their performance suggests the need for focused market targeting in urban vs. rural areas.

#### 5️. Economic Context Influences Consumer Decisions  
AI analysis identified that consumer purchasing power and credit accessibility play significant roles in shaping market behavior, making these factors crucial for long-term forecasting.

## AI Support Explanation  

I used IBM Granite — a Large Language Model (LLM) developed by IBM to enhance the analysis and discovery process.  
Granite’s capabilities were used in several parts of this project:

### 1. Generating Descriptive Analysis  
Granite automatically summarized dataset structures, identifying the most relevant columns, time frames, and sales patterns.  
This made it easier to understand large tables without manually calculating every statistic.

### 2. Interpreting Trends and Market Dynamics  
Instead of relying purely on numeric outputs, Granite provided reasoning-based insights.  
For instance, it explained why Toyota maintains a dominant position or how seasonal patterns impact consumer purchasing behavior.

### 3. Extracting Key Insights and Correlations  
I used Granite prompts to uncover relationships between brand performance, time periods, and possible external influences.  
This allowed for deeper understanding beyond simple statistical relationships.

### 4. Producing Natural-Language Summaries  
After each analysis, Granite generated concise English summaries that transformed numerical trends into meaningful business stories.  
This made communication of insights much clearer for non-technical audiences.

### 5. Providing Data-Driven Recommendations  
Granite suggested practical strategies such as optimizing marketing around Q2 and Q4, expanding financing options, and improving after-sales services to sustain customer loyalty.

## Future Work  
- Combine Granite’s insight analysis with quantitative forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) for hybrid AI prediction.  
- Integrate additional datasets such as fuel prices, inflation, or Google Trends search volume.  
- Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize Granite’s insights in real time.
